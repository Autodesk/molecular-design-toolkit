# Molecular Design Toolkit
Molecular modeling without the pain - a Python 2.7 library offering integrated simulation, visualization, analysis, and cloud computing. 

The toolkit aims to lower the barriers between you and your science by integrating mature, open source simulation packages with a readable abstract API, Jupyter notebook visualization, and native cloud computing.

## Get started
On the command line, run:
```shell
pip install moldesign
python -m moldesign intro
```

Note: depending on how python is installed on your system, some users may need to install the package as root: `sudo pip install moldesign`.

The best way to get started is to play with the examples that `python -m moldesign intro` will pull up. See [the documentation](https://autodesk.github.io/molecular-design-toolkit/) for complete API docs, development instructions and other installation scenarios.

## Code Example

You'll almost always import the package and its units module:
```python
import moldesign as mdt
from moldesign import units as u
```

Download a protein from the PDB and visualize it in 3D (in a notebook):
```python
protease = mdt.from_pdb('3AID')
protease.draw()
```

Create a small molecule and relax its geometry:
```python
mol = mdt.from_name('bipyridine')
mol.set_energy_model(mdt.models.RHF(basis='STO-3G'))
min_trajectory = mol.minimize(nsteps=20)
min_trajectory.draw_orbitals()
```

For in-depth examples, see the built-in example notebooks (run `python -m moldesign intro` to launch).

# Molecular Design Toolkit
Molecular modeling without the pain - a Python 2.7 library offering integrated simulation, visualization, analysis, and cloud computing. 

The toolkit aims to lower the barriers between you and your science by integrating mature, open source simulation packages with a readable abstract API, Jupyter notebook visualization, and native cloud computing.

## Get started
On the command line, run:
```shell
pip install moldesign
python -m moldesign intro
```

See [the documentation](docs/install.rst) for development instructions and other use cases.

## Code Example

You'll almost always import the package and its units module:
```python
import moldesign as mdt
from moldesign import units as u
```

Download a protein from the PDB and visualize it in 3D (in a notebook):
```python
protease = mdt.from_pdb('3AID')
protease.draw()
```

Create a small molecule and relax its geometry:
```python
mol = mdt.from_name('bipyridine')
mol.set_energy_model(mdt.models.RHF(basis='STO-3G'))
min_trajectory = mol.minimize(nsteps=20)
min_trajectory.draw_orbitals()
```

For in-depth examples, see the built-in example notebooks (run `python -m moldesign intro` to launch).

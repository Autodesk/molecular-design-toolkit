class GradientDescent(MinimizerBase):
    """ A careful (perhaps overly careful) gradient descent implementation designed to relax
    structures far from equilibrium.

    A backtracking line search is performed along the steepest gradient direction.

    The maximum move for any single atom is also limited by ``max_atom_move``

    Note:
        This algorithm is good at stably removing large forces, but it's very poorly suited to
           locating any type of critical point; don't use this to find a minimum!

    Args:
        mol (moldesign.Molecule): molecule to minimize
        max_atom_move (Scalar[length]): maximum displacement of a single atom
        scaling (Scalar[length/force]): unit of displacement per unit force
        gamma (float): number between 0 and 1 indicating scale factor for backtracking search
        control (float): threshold for terminating line search; this is a proportion
             (0<=``control``<=1) of the expected function decrease

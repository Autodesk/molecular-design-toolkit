    structures far from equilibrium.

    The structure is adjusted along the force direction, but the step size is capped by
        ``max_atom_move`` (.075 angstrom by default). If the energy increases after a move,
        the move is repeated with half the step size.

    Note:
        This algorithm is good at stably removing large forces, but it's very poorly suited to
           locating any type of critical point.

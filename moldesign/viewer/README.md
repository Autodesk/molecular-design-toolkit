## Viewer subpackage

The `moldesign.viewer` subpackage contains 2D and 3D visualization methods for interactive notebook work.

Nearly all of the functionality here is built on another BioNano project [Notebook Molecular Visualization Library](http://github.com/autodesk/notebook-molecular-visualization). That project, in turn, was built using [ipywidgets](http://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets), [3Dmol.js](http://github.com/3dmol/3Dmol.js), and [D3.js](http://d3js.org)

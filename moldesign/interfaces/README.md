## Interfaces subpackage

The `buckyball.interfaces` subpackage contains interfaces to other chemistry software.

In general, API users won't access these modules directly - their functionality will be imported in the appropriate top-level module (for example: to convert a DNA sequence to a 3D structure, the `ambertools.build_bdna` function is imported as `mdt.converters.build_bdna`.

The `buckyball.interfaces` subpackage stores modules that use functionality exported from other chemistry packages. In general, users won't access these modules directly - their functionality will be imported in the appropriate top-level module (for example: to convert a DNA sequence to a 3D structure, the `ambertools.build_bdna` function is imported as `buckyball.converters.build_bdna`.

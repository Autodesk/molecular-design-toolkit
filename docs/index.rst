Molecular Design Toolkit |version|
##################################

Molecular science is hard - the software shouldn't make it harder. The `Molecular Design Toolkit <http://moldesign.bionano.autodesk.com/>`_ offers access to a large and still-growing set of computational modeling methods from a science-focused, Python API. When you
call MDT functions from a Jupyter notebook, you'll also be get inline 2D and 3D visualization,
plotting support, and interactivity.

MDT is free, open source, and is built for scientific collaboration.
